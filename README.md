# Connect Four

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

> This is a React-Redux game that keeps track of the game state in the localStorage. Giving you the freedom of leaving in the middle of the game and come back later to keep playing.
